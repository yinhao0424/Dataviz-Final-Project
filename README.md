# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The [data](https://gist.github.com/yinhao0424/9f1730ca91ab6a472fc212761267fa39) I propose to visualize for my project is immigration programs from The Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) including the H1-B visa from 2011 - 2016.

 *  columns: 
 *  CASE_STATUS
 *  EMPLOYER_NAME
 *  SOC_NAME
 *  JOB_TITLE
 *  FULL_TIME_POSITION
 *  PREVAILING_WAG
 *  YEAR
 *  WORKSITE
 *  lon
 *  lat

## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. 
First one is a stacked bar chart and it shows the changes for the total number of petition, the different case status, the number of part time and full time candidates petitions along with years.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * How does the number of petition vary over time? 
     * It could be answered by a bar chart. x would be year, y would be the number of petition.
 * Is there any correlation between wages and approved rate?
      * It could be answered by a stacked bar chart. x would be year, y would be average wages of each status.
 * Are there interesting spatial patterns in case status?
      * It could be answered by a map with all the points representing different cases on it.
## Sketches
### Part 1

 * The first sketch is to build a map shows the distribution of status. 
 * The second sketch is to show each attributes change along with time. For example, How does the number of petition vary over time?
 * The third sketch is to show the correlation between different attributes. Such as, the relationship between wages and approved rate.
 ### Part 2

 * This sketch shows the extended ideas. Linked the points in the map with a bar chart to show the number of different status in detail by adding zoom/cut/brush functions. Furthermore, I'd like to add a menu bar serving as a filter to choose different years. 
 
 ## Schedule of Deliverables
  * week7:  linked map with bar chart
  * week8:  highlight with zoom and brush
  * week9:  create the remaining relationship based graphs
  * week10:  Organized all the charts and finish the tasks.

## Open Questions
Can menu serve as a filter?
