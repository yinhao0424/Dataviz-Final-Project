# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The [data](https://gist.github.com/yinhao0424/9f1730ca91ab6a472fc212761267fa39) I propose to visualize for my project is immigration programs from The Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) including the H1-B visa from 2011 - 2016.

## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a stacked bar chart and it shows the changes for the total number of petition, the different case status, the number of part time and full time candidates petitions along with years.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * How does the number of petition vary over time?
 * Is there any correlation between wages and approved rate?
 * Are there interesting spatial patterns in case status?

## Sketches

(insert one or more hand-drawn sketches of interactive visualizations that you imagine)
(describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks)

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)
