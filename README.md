# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The [data](https://gist.github.com/yinhao0424/9f1730ca91ab6a472fc212761267fa39) I propose to visualize for my project is immigration programs from The Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) including the H1-B visa from 2011 - 2016.

## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. 
First one is a stacked bar chart and it shows the changes for the total number of petition, the different case status, the number of part time and full time candidates petitions along with years.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * How does the number of petition vary over time?
 * Is there any correlation between wages and approved rate?
 * Are there interesting spatial patterns in case status?

## Sketches

The first sketch is to build a map shows the distribution of status. I want to show in each state the number of petition as well as differnt case status proportion.
The second sketch is to show each attributes change along with time. For example, How does the number of petition vary over time?
The third sketch is to show the correlation between different attributes. Such as, the relationship between wages and approved rate.

## Open Questions
I am not sure about how to based on latitude and longtitude to build a map with state and border.
